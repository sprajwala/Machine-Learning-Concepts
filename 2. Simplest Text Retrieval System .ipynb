      "java coffee refers to coffee beans produced in the indonesian island of java.  the indonesian phrase kopi java refers not only to the origin of the coffee, but is used to distinguish a style of strong, black, and very sweet coffee.  in some countries, java can refer to coffee in general.++the coffee is primarily grown on large estates that were built by the dutch in the 18th century. the five largest estates are blawan (also spelled belawan or blauan), jampit (or djampit), pancoer (or pancur), kayumas and tugosari, and they cover more than 4,000 hectares.++these estates transport ripe cherries quickly to their mills after harvest. the pulp is then fermented and washed off, using the wet process, with rigorous quality control. this results in coffee with good, heavy body and a sweet overall impression. they are sometimes rustic in their flavor profiles, but display a lasting finish. at their best, they are smooth and supple and sometimes have a subtle herbaceous note in the after-taste.++this coffee is prized as one component in the traditional \"mocca java\" blend, which pairs coffee from yemen and java. certain estates age a portion of their coffee for up to five years, normally in large burlap sacks, which are regularly aired, dusted, and flipped. as they age, the beans turn from green to light brown, and their flavor gains strength while losing acidity. aged coffees can display flavors ranging from cedar to spices such as cinnamon or clove, and often develop a thick, almost syrupy body. these aged coffees are called old government, old brown or old java.+\n",

      "java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. it is intended to let application developers \"write once, run anywhere\" (wora), meaning that compiled java code can run on all platforms that support java without the need for recompilation.++java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any java virtual machine (jvm) regardless of computer architecture. as of 2016, java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers. java was originally developed by james gosling at sun microsystems (which has since been acquired by oracle corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of sun microsystems' java platform. the language derives much of its syntax from c and c++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.++the original and reference implementation java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by sun under proprietary licenses. as of may 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the java community process, sun relicensed most of its java technologies under the gnu general public license. others have also developed alternative implementations of these sun technologies, such as the gnu compiler for java (bytecode compiler), gnu classpath (standard libraries), and icedtea-web (browser plugin for applets).+\n",

       "'java coffee refers to coffee beans produced in the indonesian island of java.  the indonesian phrase kopi java refers not only to the origin of the coffee, but is used to distinguish a style of strong, black, and very sweet coffee.  in some countries, java can refer to coffee in general.++the coffee is primarily grown on large estates that were built by the dutch in the 18th century. the five largest estates are blawan (also spelled belawan or blauan), jampit (or djampit), pancoer (or pancur), kayumas and tugosari, and they cover more than 4,000 hectares.++these estates transport ripe cherries quickly to their mills after harvest. the pulp is then fermented and washed off, using the wet process, with rigorous quality control. this results in coffee with good, heavy body and a sweet overall impression. they are sometimes rustic in their flavor profiles, but display a lasting finish. at their best, they are smooth and supple and sometimes have a subtle herbaceous note in the after-taste.++this coffee is prized as one component in the traditional \"mocca java\" blend, which pairs coffee from yemen and java. certain estates age a portion of their coffee for up to five years, normally in large burlap sacks, which are regularly aired, dusted, and flipped. as they age, the beans turn from green to light brown, and their flavor gains strength while losing acidity. aged coffees can display flavors ranging from cedar to spices such as cinnamon or clove, and often develop a thick, almost syrupy body. these aged coffees are called old government, old brown or old java.+'"
